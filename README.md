# Rothko Painting 
A project from <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a> , referring to the course "***Responsive Web Design***", the  course I took was <em> "***learn the CSS Box Model by building a Rothko Painting***".<em>

It's a project, that I used **CSS3** and **HTML5** to learn about **box model**, **spacing**, **border**, **padding** and others elements

I try reacreate a painting of *<a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko" target="_blank">Mark Rothko</a>* used **HTML** and **CSS**
